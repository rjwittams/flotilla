Development fleet management. Agents, branches, PRs, and workspaces across every repo in one view.

Flotilla in cmux: Each row correlates a branch with its PR, agent sessions, and workspace automatically.

## Integrations

Available tools are auto-detected from your environment, with configurable overrides.

## How it works

- **Auto-discovery**: detects tools from your environment, with configurable overrides.
- **Providers**: Provider implementations collect fragments of data and surface available actions. Multiple providers of the same type can coexist (e.g. GitHub Issues alongside Linear).
- **Correlation**: Fragments sharing identity are transitively merged into unified work items. One row per unit of work.
- **Workspace templates**: `.flotilla/workspace.yaml` defines pane layouts. One keystroke creates a multi-agent workspace. Native layouts (e.g KDL for Zellij) to come.
- **Multi-repo**: each repo is a tab with its own detected providers.

## Quickstart

```
cargo install --git https://github.com/rjwittams/flotilla
cd your-repo
flotilla
```

Or from source:

```
git clone https://github.com/rjwittams/flotilla
cd flotilla
cargo run -- --repo-root /path/to/your/repo
```

Repo root is auto-detected from the current directory if omitted. Multiple repos can be managed as tabs.

## Future direction

- Web dashboard — alternative/in addition to TUI (#36)
- Persistent sessions (#32)
- Multi-host coordination — coordinate across your development hosts with a unified view. Hand off sessions to hosts with appropriate resources. (#33)
- User-oriented filtering for large team repos (#34)
- Agent integrations — expose fleet functionality to agents, e.g. transferring work items/agent sessions to a host with required resources, like a local GPU or iOS simulator. (#35)
