# CLI, Multi-Host Commands, and Integration Testing

**Date**: 2026-03-13
**Status**: Draft

## Motivation

Flotilla's multi-host peering (SSH transport, follower mode, peer relay) needs end-to-end validation across realistic network topologies — different hostnames, heterogeneous tool installations, jump boxes, VPNs. This requires:

1. A rich CLI surface that can query and control flotilla programmatically (not just the TUI)
2. Docker Compose test infrastructure simulating real deployment scenarios
3. A pytest harness driving assertions against the CLI

The CLI is a first-class goal (scriptable, composable, useful to users) and also the primary interface for integration tests.

## CLI Design

### Output Formatting

All commands support two output modes:

- **Human-friendly** (default): tables, concise status lines
- **JSON** (`--json` flag): structured output for scripting and test assertions

A shared output layer renders the same data in both formats, established as a pattern for all commands.

The existing `watch` command already serializes `DaemonEvent` via serde — `--json` for streaming commands uses this same serialization, one JSON object per line (JSONL).

### Command Grammar

Commands follow a `<noun> [scope] <verb>` grammar. Scoping narrows context:

```
flotilla work                              # all work items
flotilla repo <path_or_slug> work          # work for one repo
flotilla host <host> work                  # work from one host
```

The `host <host>` prefix targets commands at a remote host. Two mechanisms:

- **Query commands** (`status`, `providers`, `work`): answered from locally-replicated peer data — no remote round-trip needed since the daemon already holds peer snapshots.
- **Control commands** (`repo add`, `refresh`, `checkout`): require remote command forwarding. This extends the peer protocol beyond data replication — the local daemon sends a `Command` to the remote peer and proxies the `CommandResult` back. This is a new capability requiring additions to `PeerDataMessage` (or a parallel request/response channel over the SSH transport).

```
flotilla host feta repo add /path/to/repo   # remote command forwarding
flotilla host feta providers                 # answered from local replica
```

`path_or_slug` matching: full path, repo name, or unique substring.

### Query Commands (one-shot, request/response)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `flotilla status` | High-level overview: repos, health, peers |
| `flotilla host providers` | Host-level provider discovery (binaries, sockets, auth) |
| `flotilla repo [path_or_slug] providers` | Provider instances active for a specific repo |
| `flotilla repo [path_or_slug]` | Repo overview (branches, PRs, sessions) |
| `flotilla work` | Correlated work items across repos |

### Control Commands (mutating, block until result)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `flotilla refresh [repo]` | Trigger refresh (omit repo = all) |
| `flotilla repo add <path>` | Track a new repo |
| `flotilla repo remove <path_or_slug>` | Stop tracking a repo |
| `flotilla repo <path_or_slug> checkout <branch> [path]` | Create checkout (path optional) |
| `flotilla checkout <path_or_branch> remove` | Remove a checkout (by worktree path or branch name) |

Control commands send `Command` variants through `execute()`, block until `CommandFinished`, and exit with appropriate exit codes.

### Multi-Host Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `flotilla host list` | All hosts, connection status, providers |
| `flotilla host <host> status` | Detailed single host view |
| `flotilla host <host> providers` | Remote host provider discovery |
| `flotilla topology` | Peering topology (table, `--json`, `--dot` for Graphviz) |

### Streaming Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `flotilla watch` | Stream daemon events (`--json`, filterable) |
| `flotilla host <host> watch` | Events from specific host |
| `flotilla repo <path_or_slug> watch` | Events for specific repo |
| `flotilla checkout <path> watch` | Events for specific checkout |

`watch` uses the existing `DaemonEvent` subscription. The scope prefix applies a filter — same stream, narrower view.

## Protocol and API Additions

The CLI requires new capabilities in the daemon API and wire protocol:

### New `DaemonHandle` methods

The existing trait has `get_state`, `list_repos`, `execute`, `refresh`, `add_repo`, `remove_repo`, `replay_since`. New methods needed:

- `list_hosts()` — returns configured hosts with connection status
- `get_host_providers(host)` — provider discovery results for a host (from local replica for remote hosts)
- `get_topology()` — peer connection graph with sync state
- `get_local_providers()` — host-level discovery results (assertions, detected binaries/sockets/auth)

These map to new request types in the wire protocol (`dispatch_request` in `server.rs`).

### Discovery data serialization

`EnvironmentBag` and `EnvironmentAssertion` need `Serialize`/`Deserialize` derives (or a new summary type in `flotilla-protocol`) to surface host-level discovery data via the CLI. The provider registry should retain a summary of what was discovered, not just the constructed provider instances.

### Remote command forwarding

Control commands targeted at remote hosts (`host <host> repo add`) require extending the peer transport to carry request/response messages, not just `PeerDataMessage` replication data. This could be:
- New variants on `PeerDataMessage` (`CommandRequest`, `CommandResponse`)
- Or a parallel request/response channel over the same SSH connection

This is scoped to Issue 3 (control commands) and is the most significant protocol addition.

### Refresh scoping

`Command::Refresh` needs an optional repo parameter to support `flotilla refresh <repo>` vs `flotilla refresh` (all repos).

## Docker Infrastructure

### Image Strategy

**Base + role layers:**

- `flotilla-base`: Debian slim, multi-stage Rust build, SSH server, flotilla binary, minimal user setup
- Role images `FROM flotilla-base`, add per-role tooling
- Build inside the container (multi-stage) for correctness — no cross-compile needed

**Roles:**

| Role | Providers | Coding Agent | Session Manager | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| `workstation` | Full (`gh`, all providers) | claude | tmux + zellij, shpool | Leader, workspace transfer testing |
| `follower-codex` | Local only (VCS, workspace) | codex | shpool | Persistent sessions |
| `follower-gemini` | Local only (VCS, workspace) | gemini | No shpool | Direct SSH spawn |
| `jumpbox` | Minimal (SSH only) | None | None | Follower mode, relay only |

Coding agents in test containers are real installations — binaries are present and discoverable by provider discovery. Auth configuration is handled at test runtime. This allows future tests to exercise agent functionality beyond just discovery validation.

### Topologies

**Topology 1 — Minimal (2-node direct SSH):**

```
[node-a: workstation] ←SSH→ [node-b: follower]
```

Single Docker network. Validates basic peering, CLI commands, event streaming.

**Topology 2 — Hub-spoke (1 workstation + 2 followers):**

```
                    [homelab-1: follower-codex]
                   /
[workstation] ←SSH→
                   \
                    [homelab-2: follower-gemini]
```

Single Docker network. Followers peer with workstation only, not each other. Tests:
- Provider heterogeneity (different coding agents, shpool vs no-shpool)
- Work correlation across 3 hosts
- Followers receive service data (PRs, issues) without having `gh`
- Session persistence: shpool (homelab-1) survives disconnect, direct spawn (homelab-2) doesn't
- Workspace transfer: disconnect tmux on workstation, respawn in zellij
- Resilience: kill workstation → followers detect → restart → resync

**Topology 3 — Jump box (3-node bastion routing):**

```
[vpn-net]                          [homelab-net]
[workstation] ←SSH→ [jumpbox] ←SSH→ [homelab]
```

Two Docker networks. Workstation cannot reach homelab directly.

Tests:
- Network isolation verified (workstation cannot SSH to homelab directly)
- Peer relay: data flows workstation → jumpbox → homelab (and back)
- `flotilla topology --dot` shows full chain
- `flotilla work` on workstation includes transitive items from homelab
- Remote commands route through jumpbox: `flotilla host homelab repo add <path>`
- Partition: kill jumpbox → workstation loses homelab visibility → restart → recovery

## Test Harness

**Language**: Python (pytest)

**Structure:**
- Fixtures for Docker Compose lifecycle (up/down per topology)
- Helper to SSH into a node and run `flotilla <command> --json`, returning parsed JSON
- Parameterized tests across topologies where applicable
- Separate test modules per topology

**Example test pattern:**

```python
def test_peer_connectivity(minimal_topology):
    result = flotilla(minimal_topology["node-a"], "host list --json")
    peers = result["hosts"]
    assert any(h["name"] == "node-b" and h["status"] == "connected" for h in peers)
```
