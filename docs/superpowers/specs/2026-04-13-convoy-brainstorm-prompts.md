# Convoy Implementation — Brainstorm Prompts

These are self-contained prompts for future brainstorm sessions, ordered by dependency. Reference the design doc at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-13-convoy-and-control-plane-design.md` for full context.

## Dependency Graph

```
1. ResourceClient trait + k8s REST prototype
2. WorkflowTemplate resource                   depends on: 1
3. Convoy resource + controller                 depends on: 1, 2
4. Task provisioning / policy                   depends on: 3
5. Presentation integration + rename            depends on: 3
6. TUI convoy view                              depends on: 3
7. AttachableSet migration                      depends on: 3, 4, 5, 6
```

Stages 4, 5, and 6 can run in parallel once 3 is complete.

## Design Decisions

### kube-rs vs raw REST

We prefer **raw REST calls** (reqwest + serde) over kube-rs for the k8s backend. Reasons:
- kube-rs is a heavy dependency with opinions about async runtime
- The `ResourceClient` trait should reflect plain REST semantics (what flotilla-cp would eventually expose), not kube-rs's `Api<T>` abstractions
- For prototyping a single-node controller loop, a simple `loop { watch, react }` is clearer than kube-rs's reconciler framework
- kube-rs doesn't provide leader election (community crate, no fencing) — not needed for single-node anyway
- We already have reqwest and serde

### Hand-written CRD YAML over macro generation

CRD specs are written as plain YAML, not generated from Rust derive macros (e.g. kube-rs `#[derive(CustomResource)]`). Reasons:
- CRD YAML diffs are readable — you see exactly what changed in the schema
- Macro-generated CRD output is opaque — derive attribute changes don't show the actual schema effect
- k8s CRD specs are full of `x-kubernetes-*` annotations and structural schema requirements that fight macro generation
- Hand-written YAML is debuggable with `kubectl apply --dry-run` and standard k8s tooling

### Pure k8s prototype (stages 1-4)

Stages 1 through 4 should be prototyped as a standalone project against real k8s, using pure k8s primitives. The goal is to understand the CRD/controller model with real tooling feedback (`kubectl get convoys`, watch events). This prototype is separate from the flotilla codebase — it validates the resource model before integrating.

Task provisioning (stage 4) is where the interesting policy question lives: should tasks create k8s-native sub-resources (Pods for containerized agents, Jobs for one-shot tasks) and let built-in k8s controllers handle lifecycle? Or should our controller manage everything directly? This is a deployment policy choice — the same convoy controller should work either way. The prototype will help answer this by trying both.

### Correlation is downstream

Convoy data feeds into the existing provider data / correlation engine as just another data source. The convoy doesn't need to know about correlation — it emits items with appropriate keys, and the correlation engine groups them with independently-discovered PRs, branches, etc. This means convoy integration with the current model is thin: convoys produce `ProviderData` items, correlation handles the rest. The exact shape of correlation in the long term is a separate concern.

---

## 1. ResourceClient Trait and k8s REST Backend

**Goal:** Define the `ResourceClient` trait that convoy controllers use, and implement it against real k8s via raw REST calls.

**Context:** Flotilla's convoy system needs a k8s-style resource API (get/list/watch/create/update/delete with resourceVersion). Controllers are written against a trait so they can run against k8s REST (prototyping), a future flotilla-cpHTTP backend, or InProcessflotilla-cp (zero-dependency laptop case). See the flotilla-cp design doc for the full vision.

This should be prototyped as a **standalone project** outside the flotilla codebase — a minimal Rust binary that registers CRDs and does CRUD + watch against a local k8s cluster (minikube). k3s is not viable (Linux-only); Go's goroutine stack model prevents embedding any Go-based k8s API server as a library, so the production in-process resource server will be a Rust/SQLite reimplementation of the required subset.

**Key questions:**
- What's the minimal trait surface that convoy controllers actually need? Start from usage, not from "what k8s has."
- How does watch work in the trait? The k8s watch API returns newline-delimited JSON with ADDED/MODIFIED/DELETED events. Streaming iterator? Async channel?
- How are resource types represented? Generic `ResourceClient<T: Resource>` with serde, or runtime-typed with serde_json::Value?
- Resource metadata subset: name, namespace, resourceVersion, labels are likely needed. Annotations? Generation/observedGeneration?
- Error model: Conflict (resourceVersion mismatch), NotFound, etc. What does the trait's error type look like?
- How much k8s discovery/negotiation is needed for raw REST? CRD registration, API group discovery, OpenAPI — what's the minimum to make `kubectl get convoys` work?

**Constraints:**
- The trait must be testable with an in-memory implementation (tests shouldn't need a running cluster).
- Must support watch (convoy controller needs to react to status changes).
- Keep it minimal — we can add methods as controllers need them.
- Use reqwest + serde, not kube-rs.

**Starting point:** k8s API reference for custom resources. The k8s watch protocol. Look at `AttachableStoreApi` in `crates/flotilla-core/src/attachable/store.rs` for the current CRUD pattern we're replacing.

---

## 2. WorkflowTemplate Resource

**Goal:** Define the WorkflowTemplate resource type — the reusable DAG definition that convoys instantiate.

**Context:** A WorkflowTemplate defines the shape of a workflow: named tasks, their process definitions (role + command), and dependency edges between tasks. It's a pure data resource (no controller needed). Templates don't specify where things run (host/checkout/environment) — that's resolved at convoy launch time.

Today's `WorkspaceTemplate` (`.flotilla/workspace.yaml`) defines content (roles + commands) and layout (pane arrangement) for a single task. WorkflowTemplate generalizes this to a DAG of tasks. Single-task workflows should be backwards-compatible with the workspace template experience.

Part of the standalone k8s prototype from stage 1.

**Key questions:**
- What's the YAML format? How does it relate to/differ from the existing workspace.yaml?
- How do single-task workflows degrade gracefully to the current workspace template experience?
- Where do templates live? `.flotilla/workflows/` in repo? Global config? Both with precedence? As k8s resources (like ConfigMaps)?
- How are process definitions expressed? Just `role + command` for now, but what's the extension point for future agent configuration (system prompts, permissions, hooks)?
- How are DAG edges expressed? `depends_on: [task_name]` is simple — is it sufficient?
- How does template rendering/variable substitution work? Current `WorkspaceTemplate::render()` does simple `{var}` replacement.
- Validation: what makes a template invalid? (cycles in DAG, duplicate task names, missing dependency references)

**Starting point:** Read `crates/flotilla-core/src/template.rs` for the current `WorkspaceTemplate`. Read the convoy design doc's WorkflowTemplate section. Look at Argo Workflow's template model for comparison (useful reference, but we want something lighter).

---

## 3. Convoy Resource and Controller

**Goal:** Define the Convoy resource type and build a minimal controller that manages convoy lifecycle through the workflow DAG.

**Context:** A Convoy is a named workflow instance. It references a WorkflowTemplate, tracks task states, and advances through the DAG as tasks complete. This is the core of the new model — it replaces the "branch -> checkout -> terminals" interaction loop with "convoy -> (provisions everything needed) -> work happens."

Part of the standalone k8s prototype. The controller should be a simple reconciliation loop: watch convoy resources, compare desired state (workflow DAG) against observed state (task statuses), take action.

**Key questions:**
- Convoy spec: what fields? Name, workflow reference, per-task overrides (host/checkout/environment bindings)?
- Convoy status: task states, overall phase, timestamps?
- How is a convoy created? For the prototype: `kubectl apply`. For flotilla: CLI command, TUI action, eventually agent-initiated.
- The controller reconciliation loop: what does it watch, what does it do on each tick?
  - Convoy created -> mark root tasks as Ready
  - Task marked Ready -> (hand off to task provisioning, brainstorm 4)
  - Task completed -> check dependents, mark newly-unblocked tasks as Ready
  - All tasks completed -> mark convoy Completed
- How does task completion work? Initially explicit (CLI command, status patch). Eventually agents mark their own tasks complete.
- Should tasks be sub-resources of the convoy (status fields) or independent resources? Status fields are simpler for now. Independent resources give you watch/status per task but add complexity.
- How does the controller get started? In the prototype: standalone binary. In flotilla: part of the daemon.
- This controller pattern should eventually replace much of the current command/step/executor complexity. How does the reconciliation model compare to the current `StepPlan` execution?

**Dependencies:** ResourceClient trait (brainstorm 1), WorkflowTemplate (brainstorm 2).

**Starting point:** Read `crates/flotilla-core/src/executor/workspace.rs` for the current orchestration flow. Read `crates/flotilla-core/src/step.rs` for the current step execution model that convoys would replace. Read the convoy design doc.

---

## 4. Task Provisioning and Policy

**Goal:** When a convoy task becomes Ready, provision the infrastructure it needs. Determine the policy boundary: what does the convoy controller create directly vs. what does it delegate to other controllers?

**Context:** This is where the convoy controller creates real things. The interesting question is the policy layer: should the controller create k8s-native resources (Pods, Jobs) and let built-in controllers handle lifecycle? Or create flotilla-specific resources and manage them directly?

For example, a task needing a containerized coding agent could:
- **k8s-native**: Create a Pod spec -> k8s schedules it -> container runs agent -> controller watches Pod status
- **flotilla-managed**: Controller calls EnvironmentProvider + TerminalPool directly -> creates terminal sessions -> watches terminal status

The k8s-native path gives you scheduling, restarts, resource limits for free. The flotilla-managed path works on a laptop without k8s. The convoy controller shouldn't care which — it creates a "task execution" resource and watches its status. The policy layer decides how that resolves.

**Key questions:**
- What's the provisioning sequence for a task? Environment first, then checkout accessibility, then processes?
- The policy boundary: what abstraction separates "what the task needs" from "how it's provided"? Is this just the ResourceClient creating different resource types depending on policy?
- For the k8s prototype: try creating Pods for tasks. What works well? What's awkward?
- For the laptop case: the same task definition should resolve to local processes via TerminalPool. How does the policy switch work?
- Host assignment: explicit in convoy spec? Defaulted? Eventually scheduled?
- Failure handling: provisioning fails — what happens to the task? Retry? Mark failed? Propagate to convoy?
- How does this relate to the current executor's command flow? The `WorkspaceOrchestrator` does: ensure environment -> ensure checkout -> ensure terminals -> bind to workspace. Is this the same sequence, just expressed as resource creation + reconciliation?

**Dependencies:** Convoy resource + controller (brainstorm 3).

**Starting point:** Read `crates/flotilla-core/src/executor/workspace.rs` (WorkspaceOrchestrator), `crates/flotilla-core/src/executor/session_actions.rs`, `crates/flotilla-core/src/hop_chain/`, and `crates/flotilla-core/src/step.rs`.

---

## 5. Presentation Integration and PresentationManager Rename

**Goal:** Rename WorkspaceManager to PresentationManager, and connect convoy tasks to the presentation layer so users can see and interact with running processes.

**Context:** The presentation manager already receives fully-resolved `Vec<(role, command_string)>` pairs and a layout template — it doesn't care where commands came from. For a single convoy task, the existing `WorkspaceAttachRequest` -> `resolve_template` -> `PaneLayout` -> create panes path works unchanged.

The new parts are:
- **Rename**: WorkspaceManager -> PresentationManager throughout the codebase. Mechanical but touches many files. The user-facing concept of "workspace" (tmux/zellij workspace) may stay — the rename is internal.
- **Task transitions**: when task A completes and task B starts, the presentation should update (add/replace panes rather than creating a new workspace).
- **Convoy TUI pane**: a flotilla TUI instance focused on the convoy, running as a pane in the presentation alongside terminal processes, showing task DAG progression.

**Key questions:**
- Reconfigure vs replace: when a new task starts, should the existing workspace gain new panes, or should a new workspace replace it? Reconfiguration needs new `update_workspace`/`add_panes` on the trait.
- What does the presentation layout look like for a multi-task convoy? One workspace for the whole convoy? One per task?
- How does the flotilla TUI pane work? It's another process in the layout — `flotilla tui --convoy <name>`? How does it get convoy state?
- Layout config: per-task? Convoy-level? Both with defaults?
- Should user-facing terminology stay as "workspace" while the internal trait is "PresentationManager"?

**Dependencies:** Convoy resource + controller (brainstorm 3).

**Starting point:** Read `crates/flotilla-core/src/providers/workspace/mod.rs` (resolve_template, build_pane_layout, WorkspaceManager trait), `crates/flotilla-core/src/providers/workspace/cmux.rs` (create_workspace implementation). Grep for `workspace_manager` in config and binding strings.

---

## 6. TUI Convoy View

**Goal:** Add convoy-aware views to the flotilla TUI — showing convoy status, task DAG progression, and navigating to task processes.

**Context:** Today the TUI shows work items (correlated groups of checkouts, PRs, sessions, terminals). The convoy becomes the primary object the user works with. The TUI needs to show:

- Convoy list (like work item table but convoy-focused)
- Convoy detail: task DAG with status indicators (Pending/Ready/Running/Completed)
- Task detail: processes, their terminal status, links to attach
- Convoy creation flow (eventually)

There's also the "convoy pane" concept from brainstorm 5: a flotilla TUI instance running inside the presentation workspace, showing convoy progression alongside terminal processes.

Convoy data feeds into the TUI through the normal provider data / snapshot path. The convoy controller produces items that become part of `ProviderData`, and correlation groups them with related work items (PRs, branches) downstream. The TUI doesn't need special convoy awareness in the correlation layer — it just needs to display convoy-shaped data well.

**Key questions:**
- Does the convoy view replace the work item table, supplement it, or is it a different tab/mode?
- How does the TUI get convoy state? Through the existing snapshot/provider data path? Or a dedicated convoy watch?
- What does the DAG visualization look like in a terminal? Simple list with indentation and status icons? Actual graph rendering?
- Task interaction: how does the user mark a task complete? Action menu? Keybinding?
- How does "attach to process terminal" work from the convoy view?
- The convoy-as-TUI-pane: is this `flotilla tui --filter convoy=<name>`? A separate subcommand?

**Dependencies:** Convoy resource + controller (brainstorm 3).

**Starting point:** Read `crates/flotilla-tui/src/widgets/repo_page.rs`, `crates/flotilla-tui/src/app/mod.rs`, `crates/flotilla-core/src/data.rs` (work item building).

---

## 7. AttachableSet Migration

**Goal:** Migrate existing AttachableSet functionality to convoys, then remove the old model.

**Context:** Once convoys handle the full lifecycle (create, provision, present, tear down), AttachableSet becomes redundant. Today's AttachableSet is a convoy with a single task — the migration should be straightforward once the convoy model is solid.

**Key questions:**
- Can migration be gradual? (new code paths create convoys, old code paths still create AttachableSets, both coexist temporarily)
- What happens to persisted AttachableSet state in `~/.config/flotilla/attachables/registry.json`? Auto-migrate on startup? Clean break?
- The binding system (`ProviderBinding`) — does it have a convoy equivalent, or do native resource references replace it entirely?
- What correlation keys do convoys emit? The existing `CorrelationKey::AttachableSet(id)` needs a convoy equivalent, but the exact shape depends on how correlation evolves. Keep it simple: convoy tasks emit the same keys their sub-resources would (Branch, CheckoutPath, etc.) and correlation groups them naturally.

**Dependencies:** All previous brainstorms (3-6) should be solid before migrating.

**Starting point:** Read `crates/flotilla-core/src/attachable/` (full module), `crates/flotilla-core/src/providers/correlation.rs`.

---

## Deferred Items

Things deliberately pushed out of earlier stages. Each stage's spec should restate the relevant ones, but the master list lives here so nothing falls through.

### From Stage 2 (WorkflowTemplate)

- **Loops / retry edges** — review → fix → review cycles. A new edge kind beyond `depends_on` is likely needed. See the WorkflowTemplate spec for details.
- **Conditional edges** — approval gates ("proceed only if reviewer approves").
- **User tasks** — a task whose "process" is a human action (confirm a generated branch name, approve a spec). Could be a new `ProcessSource` variant or a task-level `user_prompt:`.
- **Named artifacts / data flow** — a task produces a value, downstream tasks consume it. Motivating example: a one-shot haiku call generates a branch name, downstream tasks use `{branch}`. Today's branch-name-generation-plus-confirmation flow is the concrete case to design around.
- **Agent lifetime across tasks** — resume/session continuity. `implement → review → fix` wants the same coding agent, not a fresh one. Runtime semantics are unclear (same-process send-keys vs session resume vs fresh-but-context-aware), so schema shape is deferred. The `ProcessSource` enum is kept extensible so an `AgentRef { agent, resume, prompt }` variant can slot in later alongside workflow-level `agents:` declarations.
- **One-shot agent processes** — non-long-running agents that produce a value. The haiku branch-namer is the canonical case. Distinct from long-running agent processes that stay up for interaction.
- **Optional and multi-valued / richer inputs** — starting a workflow from 0+ issues (each with number, title, body, URL), not just a scalar string. Also: default values, typed inputs, `required: false`. Runtime semantics likely follow Argo's "absent value ⇒ empty string substitution." Deferred as a bundle because the runtime semantics and schema shape move together.
- **Additional interpolation scopes** — `{{tasks.<name>.outputs.*}}`, `{{items.*}}`, `{{workflow.creationTimestamp}}`, `{{workflow.uid}}`, etc. Tracks Argo's reference table as we add the corresponding runtime concepts.
- **Expression form `{{=...}}`** — Argo's expression mode (casts, filters, sprig functions). Useful once the simple form is paying its way.
- **Literal recognized-token escape** — a way to emit `{{inputs.branch}}` or `{{workflow.name}}` verbatim in prompts/commands. Foreign prefixes already pass through unchanged; this deferred item is only for flotilla-owned tokens.
- **Non-terminal content** — port-forwarding for dev servers, HTTP probes, background services. Process definitions are terminal-only in v1.
- **GitOps sync** — templates authored in project VCS, synced into the cluster by a controller (Argo CD / Flux style). Relevant when templates live in repos rather than being applied manually.

### From Stage 3 (Convoy resource + controller)

See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-14-convoy-resource-design.md` for the spec.

- **`PlacementPolicy` resource** — named, default, auto-discovered (today's `docker@host` style). Eventually delegates to or is implemented by a `PersistentAgent`. Stage 3's Convoy references one by opaque string in `spec.placement_policy`; Stage 4 reifies.
- **`PersistentAgent` resource** — one resource type with k8s-style labels/selectors. Quartermaster, Yeoman, TestCoach, SecurityReviewer, etc. are conventionally-labeled instances. Agent runtime shape deliberately open: managed CLI (input-send), external CLI (shell-out), headless JSON/ACP, or internal LLM loop. All presentable — CLI by attaching terminals, others via interaction-log views.
- **Presentation-scope decoupling** — `PresentationManager` at full-flotilla / repo / convoy scopes, no longer coupled to a single workspace.
- **Interactive launch UX** — CLI/TUI flow: fetch template → infer inputs from context (current branch, selected issues) → present for approval → create convoy.
- **Typed `InputValue` variants** — `Issue`, `IssueList`, `Branch`, `ChangeRequest`. Requires matching `InputDefinition.kind` in `WorkflowTemplate` (Stage 2 revision). Enables UI-driven workflow discovery ("user has issues selected → find workflows that accept issue[]") and semantic downstream use (correlation, PR metadata).
- **Label-based workflow discovery** — alternative or complement to typed inputs; `flotilla.work/accepts: issue` label on `WorkflowTemplate`.
- **Workflow composition (`includes`)** — sub-workflows; transitive snapshotting into `observed_workflows` (the map shape in Stage 3 is already forward-compatible). Opens snapshot-at-root vs snapshot-per-include choice.
- **Template versioning / rev references** — `spec.workflow_ref_revision` for convoys that want a specific template version. Stage 3 just snapshots whatever was current at init.
- **Convoy re-run** — copy a convoy, reset status, re-snapshot against newer template. Not a common case, but useful enough to capture.
- **Convoy cancellation** — user-initiated cancel producing `ConvoyPhase::Cancelled`. The phase is reserved in Stage 3 but never produced.
- **Admission webhook / fast-feedback validation** — complements the client-side Convoy validator once shared-cluster authoring demands it.
- **Controller deployment and leader election.** Stage 3 runs the controller as a single example binary. Intended trajectory:
  - (a) Every controller uses a k8s `Lease` resource for leader election — exactly one replica active.
  - (b) The regular `flotilla` binary embeds controllers, activated by default, claiming leases unless explicitly disabled. Single-process installs get controllers for free.
  - (c) Cluster-native deployments schedule N flotilla daemon pods into the cluster, all competing for the same leases — standard k8s HA.
  - (d) Open problem: leader election for flotilla-cp *itself* when embedded across multiple daemons. Leases depend on the API server, which is what needs electing — a separate (consensus / external coordinator / static leader) mechanism, not a convoy-controller concern.

### From Stage 4a (Task provisioning via flotilla-daemon placement)

See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-14-task-provisioning-design.md` for the spec. Stage 4a is scoped to the flotilla-daemon placement column of the state×placement matrix; cluster-native placement is Stage 4k.

- **Stage 4k**: k8s cluster-native placement backend (Pods). Requires image-as-resource, cross-cluster checkout, selector resolution, per-tool config preparation. Each is a real design problem; deserves its own brainstorm.
- **Image as a cluster resource** — declarative spec with availability guarantees ("make this image accessible from this provider"), on-demand vs pre-fetched, registry policy. Likely a CRD authored in source control like workflows.
- **Selector resolution** (capability → concrete agent command). Carried over from Stage 2; agent processes still cannot run end-to-end until this lands. Tool processes work in Stage 4a.
- **Auto-discovery of additional policies / discovered resources pattern** — controller for "found lying around" resources with explicit out-of-band lifecycle metadata.
- **Agent-side completion CLI** — agents marking their own task complete via a CLI command that issues a status patch.
- **Per-tool config preparation** in environments (`~/.claude` shuttling, auth tokens, etc.). Carried forward as a known gap for the Docker variant.
- **Step-plan retirement** — `StepPlan` → convoy-driven coordination throughout flotilla-core. Bigger refactor; not Stage 4a.
- **Multi-host placement** — SSH-reachable Hosts, mesh-aware Host resources, label-selector host targeting.
- **Bosun-style automatic restart / repair / cleanup** — restart policies, terminal-session restarts on inner-command crash, cleanup on terminal task transitions.
- **Convoy launched against an existing Checkout** — workflow flexibility for "use this existing tree as the work area," constrains compatible environments.
- **Logical `Repository` resource** — Stage 4a only has `Clone` (one per URL+env). A future `Repository` would be the URL-level identity: canonical URL + aliases/mirrors, declared default branch (distinct from observed), GitHub/GitLab owner+slug anchor for ChangeRequestTracker/IssueProvider config, the anchor for cross-env "show me all clones of this repo" queries. When it lands, `ConvoySpec.repository: { url }` becomes `ConvoySpec.repository_ref: <name>` and `Clone` gains a `repository_ref` back-pointer.
- **Clone extensions** — Stage 4a's Clone carries URL + env_ref + path + default_branch. Future additions: credentials, per-clone workspace.yaml location, badge metadata, default-checkout tracking (the working tree from a non-bare clone vs. explicit Checkout resources). Each is an additive field.
- **Detached-head / sha / tag refs on Checkout** — useful for agent-driven bisect workflows and pinned-version provisioning.
- **Shared Docker environments as a placement variant** — needs the shared-env-plus-per-task-checkout composability question solved.
- **Meta-policy variant** for PlacementPolicy — delegate to a Quartermaster agent that picks among other policies. Sits on top of `PersistentAgent` (which is its own deferred item).
- **TUI/CLI binary split** — separate the TUI from the CLI in `flotilla` as the next structural cleanup. Stage 4a creates `flotillad`; the user-facing `flotilla` binary still bundles TUI and CLI.
- **Per-task restart policies / explicit retry UX** — a way to say "retry this failed task" without manually deleting resources.
- **Auto-cleanup of stopped sessions on terminal task transitions** — opt-in policy field; today TerminalSessions stay alive until the TaskWorkspace cascades on Convoy deletion.
- **Vessel / Crew / Shipment naming pass** — convoy-themed renames once the abstractions settle: TaskWorkspace → Vessel, processes → Crew, artifacts → Shipment.
- **VCS abstraction in resource shape** — Clone and Checkout are git-shaped in v1; future `vcs:` discriminator for hg / fossil / etc.
- **Cross-env mounts** — Stage 4a's Environment mounts use a `source_path` field implicitly resolved against the env's host. A future cross-env mount story (mounting paths from one Environment into another) would add `from_env` alongside; existing entries default to "same host's host_direct env."
- **Exit-code-as-completion opt-in** — tasks where a designated "progress-bearing" process (e.g. one-shot `cargo test`) should drive task completion. Requires extending `TerminalPool` to surface inner-command exit events. Watcher-kind processes (test runners, dev servers, log tails) opt out.
- **CLI shortcutting** — env-var-derived context propagated into terminal sessions so processes can issue short-form CLI commands (`flotilla complete` instead of `flotilla convoy <name> task <task> complete`). Part of a wider "how CLI infers context" story.
- **Per-task retry / convoy-task reset** — Stage 3's fail-fast plus Stage 4a's "no in-place retry" means a failed task forces a fresh convoy. Future work: a `ResetTaskToPending` (or similar) convoy-controller patch and CLI affordance to re-attempt without recreating everything.
- **Richer convoy CLI surface** — Stage 4a ships exactly one CLI verb (`task complete`). Future verbs (create, list, inspect, cancel, mark-failed, kill-session, reset-task) each currently require their own `CommandAction` variant + client method + daemon handler.
- **Client/daemon protocol convergence with resource-management protocol** — the long-term direction: client/daemon protocol becomes essentially HTTP-over-UDS, mirroring the resource-management protocol controllers already speak. Eliminates per-verb mapping; naturally supports remote-HTTP daemons. Stage 4a is the hybrid middle. Once the one-task-convoy flow works end-to-end, safe cruft-cutting on the protocol layer becomes possible.

### From Stage 5 (Presentation integration and PresentationManager rename)

See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-15-presentation-manager-design.md` for the spec. Stage 5 ships the rename, a `Presentation` resource + reconciler, replace-on-change reconciliation, a code-level `DefaultPolicy`, and per-task TaskWorkspace teardown (tying TaskWorkspace lifecycle to task lifecycle — a semantics change from stage 4a). Creation is auto-on-`ConvoyPhase::Active` to preserve today's flotilla TUI default and passthrough terminal pool semantics.

- **Reconfigure-in-place** — task transitions tear down and rebuild the workspace in v1. Continuous reconfiguration preserves terminal scroll / focus / split ratios across transitions but needs new `PresentationManager` methods (`update_workspace`, `add_panes`, `remove_panes`) and per-multiplexer implementations. Likely lands as a `PresentationPolicy` variant (`continuous` vs `churn`) — no `Presentation` schema change.
- **`PresentationPolicy` as a CRD** — today the policy is a code-level strategy keyed off `Presentation.spec.presentation_policy_ref: String` (mirrors `placement_policy_ref`). Reification when Yeoman or multi-policy demand shows up. Parallel to the deferred `PlacementPolicy` CRD work from Stage 3.
- **Signals-and-slots layout policies** — metadata-driven slot matching (`row(main_agent, col(tabs(secondary_interactive), tabs(watchers)))`) over `TerminalSession.metadata.labels`. `ProcessDefinition.labels` is the extension point that's already in place; `DefaultPolicy` ignores them. Yeoman-era work.
- **Multiple presentation managers per Presentation** — registry still returns one preferred manager. `AppliedPresentation.presentation_manager: String` (singular) today; future expansion to `Vec<_>` is additive. Motivating use cases: split presentations across users, or pair a multiplexer workspace with an external side-by-side windowing tool (tentatively **porthole**, a cleat-like process handling desktop-level composition).
- **Explicit presentation-trigger UX / split "convoy ran" from "convoy presented"** — v1 auto-creates one Presentation on `ConvoyPhase::Active`. Future triggers (explicit UI command, Yeoman decision, policy table) swap one site in the convoy reconciler — no Presentation schema change. A convoy can in principle run to completion without ever being presented.
- **Vessel lifecycle beyond existence (bouncing workflows)** — stage 5 ties TaskWorkspace existence to "task is active and presentable." Future workflows that bounce between states (dev → GPU runner → iOS tester, or review-then-fix-then-review) will want an independent "presentable" bit distinct from existence, so a task can be alive but hidden and later re-shown without losing state. Requires distinguishing the work-continuation contract from the presentation-visibility contract on TaskWorkspace (Vessel).
- **Shared-environment / shared-checkout placement cleanup** — stage 5's TaskWorkspace finalizer blanket-deletes the task's Environment and Checkout, safe under stage 4a's per-task placement assumption. Shared-environment placement variants (deferred from stage 4a) need owner-list / reference-count semantics before they can land — the finalizer can't just delete a shared resource when one of its TaskWorkspace owners dies.
- **Inner-command crash cleanup** — stage 5 resolves "cleanup of stopped sessions on terminal task transitions" partially via the TaskWorkspace finalizer cascade. Cleanup of sessions whose inner command crashed *while the task is still Running* remains deferred (that's a process-restart semantics question, not a lifecycle question).
- **`Artifact` resource** — named task outputs that downstream tasks consume (already deferred from Stage 2 for data flow). Selector-based presentation generalises: a future layout policy could render artifacts alongside terminal sessions, same selector machinery, no Presentation schema change.
- **Richer process metadata via `TerminalSession.spec.labels`** — Stage 5 uses `metadata.labels` for everything, since that's what `list_matching_labels` queries. A separate `spec.labels` field (distinct from object labels) may earn its keep later for policy inputs that shouldn't drift onto object labels.
- **Non-atomic replace handling** — v1 `PresentationRuntime.apply` does delete-then-create. If create fails after delete succeeds, the Presentation ends up with no live workspace; next reconcile retries with `previous: None`. Documented as a v1 limitation. Two-phase apply (prepare new, swap, tear down old) lands when reconfigure-in-place does.
- **Multi-task passthrough compatibility** — passthrough terminal pools run processes inside the attached workspace. Replace-on-change kills them on every task transition. Fine for single-task convoys. Multi-task passthrough support arrives with reconfigure-in-place (no teardown during transitions).
- **User-facing terminology revision** — Stage 5 rename is internal only. The "workspace" concept in TUI copy still means the multiplexer-level unit (which cmux natively calls a workspace, zellij calls tabs, tmux calls screens). A coherent user-facing pass lands once the presentation layer's richer model (Yeoman-driven reconfig, nested multiplexers, porthole-like external windowing) stabilises enough to warrant renaming.
- **Owner-reference cascade in flotilla-cp backends** — Stage 5 uses explicit finalizer-based cleanup because the in-memory and HTTP backends don't implement k8s-style owner-reference garbage collection. Implementing cascade at the backend level would let the TaskWorkspace finalizer be much simpler (just remove the finalizer; backend deletes children). Sizable work, orthogonal to stage 5's scope.
- **Live-multiplexer coverage for `delete_workspace`** — Stage 5 adds focused replay-style tests per implementation (cmux, tmux, zellij). Broader multi-presentation-manager coverage and the tmux/zellij feature gaps are separate work.
